    <p>The product involves the following components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>CC Catalog</b>, where CC licensed and public domain works are
        ingested. [<a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog"

        >]
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CC Catalog API</b>, our open API, used by CC Search to make the
        Catalog discoverable. [<a

        >][<a href="https://search.creativecommons.org">Website</a>]
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      CC Catalog ingests and processes CC licensed and public domain works, then
      makes that data available to CC Catalog API. CC Catalog API is publicly
      accessible, and is used to serve the data from the catalog to CC Search.

    <b>We keep track of our work in three projects in GitHub:</b>

          >CC Search Active Sprint</a
        >
      </dt>
      <dd>
        &bull; The best place to start! If an issue isn’t in progress yet, and
        is marked for community contribution, you’ll know it’s our highest
        priority.

        &bull; The column called “Next Sprint” contains what our second highest
        priority items are.

      <dd>
        &bull; The current quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) will tell you what we plan
        to work on, up to three months out.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        &bull; Check out the “Any Time/Community” for some fun tickets that
        aren’t a high priority for CC staff, but would be great if they got
        built.

    <h4>Participate in Usability Tests and User Interviews</h4>
    <p>
      When we’re rolling out a specific feature, we do usability tests to test
      the proposed experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any point in time, we’re engaging with our users through user
      interviews, where we learn more about attitudes towards the product as it
      stands, and dig into expansion areas we’re considering.
    </p>
